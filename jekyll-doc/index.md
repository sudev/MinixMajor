##Experiments with Minix Operating System

This project aimed at familiarizing Kernel programming by adding new features to Minix 3 Operating system. Implementing support immediate files for Minix filesystem was attempted along with a proper understanding of new Virtual Filesystem of Minix Operating system.    


**MINIX 3** is a free, open-source, operating system designed to be highly reliable, flexible, and secure. It is based on a tiny microkernel running in kernel mode with the rest of the operating system running as a collection of isolated, protected, processes in user mode.

**Virtual File System** is an abstraction layer – over the file system implementations – in the operating system.

**Immediate Files** are basically storage for small files where the data is stored directly in the inode, without the need to traverse pointers to external blocks.
