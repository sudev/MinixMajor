# Message Passing Properties

* Minix uses the concept of a message to support communication between processes. This is used universally througout Minix whenever one process needs to access another.  

* Minix user processes can only send/receive messages to system processes, not to other user processes. 
  
* Minix system processes can send messages to other system processes and reply to user process messages subject to certain restrictions.

* The following message passing functions are implemented by the kernel:

    * send
    * receive
    * sendrec (send/receive)
    * notify
    * echo  
* The first three use the rendezvous style message passing. So sendrec in a user process will block the user if the destination system process is currently doing something other than trying to receive an new request message.  

* The _syscall function used by user level programs actually uses the sendrec (send/receive) function to send a request and receive a reply.

* The notify type message does not use the rendezvous. That is, it does not get blocked if the destination is not yet ready to receive the notification.

* The echo is used by the kernel process for passing a message from a process to itself.

# Message Format

A message consists of: the process ID of the opposing process (the receiving process if the process is sending a message), an identifier telling the process what sort of message it is, and then a union for holding arguments. There is a union here to allow for a variety of sets of parameters. The code snippet below shows the message structure :

{% highlight c %}

typedef struct {
  endpoint_t m_source;		/* who sent the message */
  int m_type;			/* what kind of message is it */
  union {
	mess_1 m_m1;
	mess_2 m_m2;
	mess_3 m_m3;
	mess_4 m_m4;
	mess_5 m_m5;
	mess_7 m_m7;
	mess_8 m_m8;
	mess_6 m_m6;
	mess_9 m_m9;
	mess_10 m_m10;
  } m_u;
} message __aligned(16);
 
{% endhighlight %}
