##Experiments with Minix Operating System
* * *
This project is aimed at familiarizing Kernel programming by adding new features to Minix 3 Operating system. 
* Implementing support for immediate files in Minix file system.
* Understanding of Minix Virtual File System.


**MINIX 3** is a free, open-source, operating system designed to be highly reliable, flexible, and secure. It is based on a tiny microkernel running in kernel mode with the rest of the operating system running as a collection of isolated, protected, processes in user mode.

**Virtual File System** is an abstraction layer over the file system implementations in the operating system.

**Immediate Files** A file where the entire data contents are stored in the inode block containing file meta-data.

[MINIX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX) is a Unix-like computer operating system based on a microkernel architecture created by [Andrew S. Tanenbaum](http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/) for educational purposes; MINIX also inspired the creation of the Linux kernel. MINIX (from "mini-Unix") was first released in 1987, with its complete source code made available to universities for study in courses and research. It has been free and open source software since it was re-licensed under the BSD license in April 2000[ *(more about license)*](http://wiki.minix3.org/FAQ#Legal_Questions).
