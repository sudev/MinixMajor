\begin{abstract}
This project aims to study the Minix 3 microkernel and implement a support for immediate files which is currently unavailable. An immediate file is a file whose data is not stored in a data block, but directly inside the inode itself. With such an implementation, data fragmentation in the file system caused by small files can be solved and number of disk accesses can be reduced.
