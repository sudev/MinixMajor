###Where to get help ? 

* [Minix 3 Developer Guide](http://wiki.minix3.org/en/DevelopersGuide)
* [Minix 3 Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/minix3)

###Recomended books ?

* [Operating Systems: Design And Implementation 3rd Edition](http://www.flipkart.com/operating-systems-design-implementation-3rd/p/itmdytczcxvugj3h?affid=sudevdevgm)   
  This Minix Book written by Andrew Tannenbaum is helpful to very understand Minix 3 structure and operating system concepts. The book uses Minix 3.1 version source code for discussion, the current version 3.2.1 varies significantly from 3.1. VFS can was not implemented in 3.1 version, so you wont be finding this book useful to understand VFS.

* [The C Programming Language](http://www.flipkart.com/c-programming-language-ansi-version/p/itmdvtxfez9wyx3x?affid=sudevdevgm)   
  Minix source contains lots of macro guards and preprocessing *(Section 4.11)* . This book also contains a small introduction to UNIX system interface, which we found helpful to get an overview of low level system calls. *(Chapter 8 : The UNIX system interface)* .
