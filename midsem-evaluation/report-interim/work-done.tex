\section{Understanding Minix File system System Structure}

The Minix Filesystem architecture has Virtual File system (VFS) and Minix File System (MFS). Where the VFS is an abstraction layer over the file system implementations in the operating system. It also provides a common interface to several kinds of file system implementations. \\
Implementing a system call requires a proper understanding of both VFS and MFS.

%Please refer to Appendix I for detailed steps.
\section{Introduction of O\_CREATI flag to Open system call}
\subsection{Motive}
Creation of Immediate files / Regular files according to the flag passed in Open system call. By defaut it uses the O\_CREAT flag which creates a regular file, we added a O\_CREATI flag to create a immediate file.
\subsection{Approach}
Adding an additional Oflag to open() system call namely O\_ CREATI  with value 00110 in the file fcntl.h. \\	
Writing a C program to test the working of the system call.\\
Rebuilding the entire system.
\subsection{Result}
We were successful in making a change in open file system call and verified it using a C program.

\section{Addition of I\_IMMEDIATE in I\_MODE flag bits }
An additional I\_IMMEDIATE flag bit was added to I\_MODE flag bits along with default I\_REGULAR flag in the file const.h. These flag bits are saved inside the Inode. These flags are helpful in distinguishing the files at later stages.
