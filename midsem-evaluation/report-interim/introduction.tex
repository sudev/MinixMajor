The paper discusses various data structures used in the Virtual File System and their operation. The communication between the VFS and the any file system implementations are explained. Overall, an abstract layer VFS has been designed and implemented, which handles all system calls related to the file system and allows for client applications to access different types of file systems in a uniform way. It also provides a common interface to several kinds of file system implementations.
