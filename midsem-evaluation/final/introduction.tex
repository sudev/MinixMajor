This paper presents a general description of the Minix Virtual File system layer.It covers the design principles, the components and their functionalities.
The various data structures used in the Virtual File System and the operations related to them are described. The communication between the VFS and the actual file system implementations are explained to a great extent.
In order to demonstrate the overall mechanism of the MINIX Virtual File system, the paper provides the main steps of the execution of a system call which gives a clear idea about the structure of the VFS.
Overall, an abstract layer has been designed and implemented, which is in charge of controlling the overall mechanism of the VFS by issuing accurate requests for the appropriate FS servers during the system calls.
