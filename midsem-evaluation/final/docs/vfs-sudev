###Introduction to Design of VFS in Minix Operating System. 

The MINIX Virtual File system is built in a   
 
* distributed
* multiserver 
* manner:

it consists of a top-level VFS process and separate FS process for each mounted partition.

The top-level VFS process receives the requests from user programs through
system calls. If actual file system operation is involved the VFS requests the corresponding FS process to do the job. This dependency is depicted by [Figure].

	The top level VFS is the virtualization layer here which will 		requests from the process and routes the request to specific 		filesystem  server.
