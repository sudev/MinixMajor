\chapter{Work Done}

\section{Setting up Minix 3 development environment}
Installation of Minix 3 was done using Virtualbox({\em Virtualization software}) in Linux based host machine.\\
%Please refer to Appendix I for detailed steps.
\section{Modification of Kernel}
\subsection{Motive}
A small project was done to familiarise with the Minix 3 operating system code base.
\subsection{Problem Statement}
Print out the name of every file that is being executed by the OS.
\subsection{Approach}
Locate the kernel source file that implements the exec system call.\\	
Insert a printf statement appropriately in the located file.\\
Rebuild the entire system.
\subsection{Solution}
The implementation of the exec system call was found in file do\_exec.c under /usr/src/kernel/system/ of the minix source tree.\\
The name of the process that is being executed is captured using the variable { \em name} and is printed out.\\
The system is rebuilt using the command {\em make clean} and { \em make build} inside /usr/src/ folder.
