\chapter{Problem Statement}

%Implementation of an immediate file in MINIX 3 file system, which will help in saving space and improve the %performance for small files. Files smaller than 32 Bytes can be accommodated in the inode itself which is usually %used to store the pointers to disk block.

Understand the VFS and implement support for Immediate Files in Minix Filesystem.\\ \linebreak
 {\bf Specifications}:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item An Immediate file is created only when we pass an open flag O\_CREATI (you will have to define this open flag constant).
\begin{itemize}
\item by default we use open system calls to create a regular file:
    open("filename", O\_CREAT , 0666);
    
\item  now for creating immediate file we will define a new constant O\_CREATI and open system call with parameter O\_CREATI should create an immediate file:
    open("filename", O\_CREATI, 0666);   
\end{itemize}

\item All other file operations (open, delete, read, write ...) should work on immediate files.
\item When size of immediate file reaches 32 Bytes the filesystem should return an error. 

\end{itemize}
